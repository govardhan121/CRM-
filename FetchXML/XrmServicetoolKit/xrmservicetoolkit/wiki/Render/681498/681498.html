<div class="wikidoc"><b>CRM 2011 Rollup 12 is coming</b><br /> <br />New year has always been very busy for lots of things. There is no doubt for us, MSCRM consultants...<br /><br />Last week, i got an email from Microsoft CRM team to notice me that my personal CRM online subscription will be updated to Rollup 12 which was exciting news because i finally have an environment to test and development XrmServiceToolkit and make an effort to support cross browser. <br /><br />The upgrade obviously is a big deal for everyone. There are some immediate problems which i have seen for the toolkit after my instance was running RU12. <br /><br />Version 1.4.0 is far from perfection at its current stage to support cross browser cause there will be so many things to do and so much testing shall be done. <br /><br />If you have used the toolkit previously for your project, thanks very much for your support. For version 1.4.0, download and try it out using a <u>testing</u> environment and let me know issues and bugs. <br /><br />Happy Coding,<br />Jaimie</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
