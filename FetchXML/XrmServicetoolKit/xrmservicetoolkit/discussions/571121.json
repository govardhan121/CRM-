I have it set to be used on two fields: one is a free text, and the other is a Boolean.\r<br />\n<br />\nUsing the following XML (names and words changed to protect the innocent):<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;help&gt; \n    &lt;entity name=&quot;contact&quot;&gt; \n        &lt;attribute name='new_myfield_short_text'&gt; \n            &lt;shorthelp&gt;Some ToolTip&lt;/shorthelp&gt; \n        &lt;/attribute&gt;\n        &lt;attribute name='new_myfield_bool'&gt; \n            &lt;shorthelp&gt;Some other ToolTip&lt;/shorthelp&gt; \n        &lt;/attribute&gt; \n    &lt;/entity&gt;\n&lt;/help&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<strong>The ToolTip appears properly for the first field, but not the 2nd (boolean) one</strong>, but for the one with no custom text, I still get the question-mark icon. So I know I have not fat-fingered the field name. \r<br />\n<br />\nI tried some obvious stuff like fiddling with quote formats, copy and pasting the field name from the documentation generator to be very sure I've got it right, copy/pasting the original XML example and starting over, swapping the order of the fields in the XML, etc. \r<br />\n<br />\nI know there is a 2nd lookup field that impacts how this is used on Lookups. Is that true for Booleans too?\r<br />\n<br />\nI even F12-traced the code to see that all the appropriate values are being passed through  properly.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for any help.<br />\n",

It appears the Toolkit is inserting the code properly but is being rendered inconsistently.<br />\n<br />\nThis one works:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;new_internationalphonenumber&quot;&gt;\n   International Phone Number\n   &lt;img width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; id=&quot;img_new_internationalphonenumber&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot; alt=&quot;Use this field for numbers that are not in North American format.&quot; src=&quot;/_imgs/ico/16_help.gif&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;div id=&quot;help_new_internationalphonenumber&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden; position: absolute;&quot;&gt;: Use this field for numbers that are not in North American format.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>\n\nBut this one doesn't:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;new_caslconsentfororganization&quot;&gt;\n   CASL Consent for Organization\n   &lt;img width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; id=&quot;img_new_caslconsentfororganization&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot; alt=&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over something something&quot; src=&quot;/_imgs/ico/16_help.gif&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;div id=&quot;help_new_caslconsentfororganization&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden; position: absolute;&quot;&gt;: The quick brown fox jumped over something something&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>\n\n&quot;doesn't work&quot; meaning, I get the round help icon but the tooltip text doesn't appear onmouseover, just the field label &quot;CASL Consent for Organization&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nThe thing that's maddening is that even though the formats for the label are precisely the same, the first ToolTip works fine but the 2nd one doesn't appear.

In those cases, the parent TD tag didn't have a title.<br />\n<br />\nSo I fixed this by explicitly clobbering the title tag of the &lt;TD&gt; using jQuery 1.6+'s .prop method.
