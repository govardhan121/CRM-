    "Html": "Hi There.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou should only return the values which are required for better response time and performance. I guess if you do need to retrieve all 50 fields. You can use conditional expression like the following\r<br />\n<br />\nvar fooNotNull = (foo !== null) ? true : false;\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps.\r<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",

The entity I'm working with has over 700 fields. But even if requested null fields are not returned.\r<br />\n<br />\nBrian<br />\n",
