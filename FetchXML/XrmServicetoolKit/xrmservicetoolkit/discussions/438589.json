We replaced it with getClientUrl and have avoided a few issues:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nIFD vs. Non-IFD, for instance a user who may have a test environment using On Prem and the production using IFD.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nCross Domain 'Access Is Denied' errors were resolved by using getClientUrl.  In this scenario if one user accessed using HTTP and the other accessed using HTTPS.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nIs this something worth looking into for a future release or am I off somewhere?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!\r<br />\n<br />\nChris<br />\n",
