I'm a beginer on programming so I really appreciate any help on how to do this with your library.</p>\r\n<p>I understand that basically what I need is to create a js file that is called &quot;on click&quot; of the submit button of my HTML form. Then the js should:</p>\r\n<p>- Connect to the CRM</p>\r\n<p>- Create a new register on the &quot;lead&quot; database</p>\r\n<p>- Write each form item on each DB field.</p>\r\n<p>- Close the connection.</p>\r\n<p>Is that right?? Can you help me on how o do it???&nbsp;Thank you very much!!!!</p>\r\n<p>Jaume Hernandez</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
