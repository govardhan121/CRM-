None of the helper functions will lurk around the main functions.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried to add types where I could but I'm sure I missed some and even chose the wrong types in some places. Also I may have used &quot;any&quot; a bit to often in some cases ;)\r<br />\n<br />\nI also generated a documentation with typedoc. I converted the original comments from XML to jsdoc.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou should have IntelliSense in VS2015 and VSCode.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you have suggestions for improvement let me know.\r<br />\n<br />\nSince Jamie is not yet aware of my repository and he is hard to contact I will not post the link here until he approves. But you can contact me if you want to help or try out.<br />\n",
