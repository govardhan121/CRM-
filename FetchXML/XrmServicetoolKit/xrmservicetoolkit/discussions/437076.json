The following example is from SDK 5.0.14<br />\n<blockquote>\nfunction openDialogProcess(dialogId,entityName,objectId)<br />\n{<br />\nvar url = Xrm.Page.context.getClientUrl() + &quot;/cs/dialog/rundialog.aspx?DialogId=&quot; +<br />\ndialogId + &quot;&amp;EntityName=&quot; + entityName + &quot;&amp;ObjectId=&quot; + objectId;<br />\nwindow.open(url);<br />\n}<br />\n</blockquote>\nTrigging a workflow may be added but not in the coming release 1.4.1 ( Current plan for 1.4.1 is around the middle of April )\r<br />\n<br />\nHope this clears some questions.\r<br />\n<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
