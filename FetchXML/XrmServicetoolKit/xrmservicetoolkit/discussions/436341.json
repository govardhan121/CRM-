    "Html": "Hi there.<br />\n<br />\nthanks very much for the kind words and glad to know you like the library.<br />\n<br />\nIn an intranet environment, I normally do a trick to include PageData.js in my project which could be generated by the tool xrm.pagescriptprojecttemplate from SDK.<br />\n<br />\nThis PageData.js file will have the CRM server URL which could be consumed by the XrmServiceToolkit to develop using Soap service or Rest service. This allows you to <br />\n<ol>\n<li>Develop a website in the internal network to consume CRM data</li>\n<li>\nDebug your CRM web resource solution through your visual studio<br />\n....(much more as you can imagine)<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nI, however, still have issues when a cross domain issue is related (SSL connection or CRM online, etc)<br />\n<br />\nWould love to hear from you if you have an idea to make the library to support cross domain and apply authentication<br />\n<br />\nHappy Coding,<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
