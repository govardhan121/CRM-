Which in your case is not working as this is undefined.<br />\n",

For which entity?\r<br />\nThe fact that &quot;typeof (node.selectSingleNode) != &quot;undefined&quot; returns false indicates that node doesn't have a selectSingleNode function which implies that node is not an xml node and thus the response might not be valid xml. \r<br />\n<br />\nTry finding out what node contains on the tablet.
