    "Html": "Hey Loren.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn general, the result xml from soap request will include a parameter called &quot;a\\:MoreRecords&quot;. If this contains values, it will indicate there are more records for the retrieval. \r<br />\n<br />\nYou will need to search the resultXml for this if you want to retrieve all the records. You can have a look at the source code of XrmServiceToolkit.Soap.Fetch to have some ideas how the toolkit is allowed to do so. \r<br />\n<br />\nAnother way if you only care that the results are more than 5000 records, you can use an aggregate fetch xml to return the total number of records using Fetch.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps.\r<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
