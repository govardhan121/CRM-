It is not used to create/update fields and their definitions like OptionSet.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf what you mean is to retrieve the selected value of a OptionSet field of a record, then populate the value to another OptionSet (assuming same OptionSet setups for options and values), you can use &quot;Retrieve&quot; and &quot;Update&quot; method. \r<br />\n<br />\nAlways good to rely on SDK to understand the possibilities in the CRM framework\r<br />\n<br />\nKind Regards,\r<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
