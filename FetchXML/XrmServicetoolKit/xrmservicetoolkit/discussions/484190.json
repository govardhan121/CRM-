We will target the release version as stable while more results are collected from real life projects\r<br />\n<br />\nThe library itself is an open source JavaScript library used by developers. Unlike CRM solutions, I do not really see there will problems or conflicts in your project. Maybe have a talk with your manager and try to explain why you want to use the library through the development. Hope it will be okay.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your support. \r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
