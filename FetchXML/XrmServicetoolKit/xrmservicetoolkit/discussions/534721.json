    "Html": "Hallo, \r<br />\n<br />\nthe SOAP function Fetch supports a setting, to get the total record count of fetch queries. \r<br />\n<br />\n&lt;fetch mapping=&quot;logical&quot; count=&quot;5&quot; page=&quot;1&quot; returntotalrecordcount=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nIf this flag is set to true, the result will have a node &quot;TotalRecordCount&quot;. This is very important for me handle custom HTML5 grids in CRM with server paging. At the moment i execute a second query with aggregate to get the total record count of my query. But if i have the TotalRecordCount in one query, the performance will be much better. \r<br />\n<br />\nDo you plan this functionality in next releases?<br />\n",

Hopefully in the next release, if the &lt;fetch.....&gt; is provided by the user, the method will not rebuild the fetch statement.\r<br />\n<br />\nThat way your fetch query will be supported automatically.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nJaimie<br />\n",
