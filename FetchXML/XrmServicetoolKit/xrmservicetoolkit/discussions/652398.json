When we tried to import the solution into our Org (brand-new 2015 on-premise instance) we receive an error message:\r<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The solution file is invalid. The compressed file must contain the following files at its root: solution.xml, customizations.xml, and [Content_Types].xml. Customization files exported from previous versions of Microsoft Dynamics CRM are not supported.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I unzip the file from the Downloads page, I see the .xml files are not included. Is there something additional I need to download? I have been using the 2013 toolkit without issue previously. <br />\n",
