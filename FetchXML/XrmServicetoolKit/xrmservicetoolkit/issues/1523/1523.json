      "Message": "Hey There.\r\n\r\nI am not too sure if the error has actually caused by the toolkit, but I have seen this error \"Not enough storage is available to complete this operation\" elsewhere while using IE\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue from the early ages of IE. Mainly caused by a layer building process until it reaches 31 of them (for example if you have like 31 CSS files included in the page, IE will crash. You could find a bit research information through out the internet.\r\n\r\nThere maybe also a memory leak which could cause issue like this. \r\n\r\nI will keep a note and see if I have the same issue in some instances of my development, but as for now, I could not give you a proper solution.\r\n\r\nRegards,\nJaimie\r\n\r\n",
