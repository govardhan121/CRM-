      "Message": "I had a look at the changes and the changes was made due to the fact that now the async flag was dropped in favor of checking if there is a callback function called. If not the call will be sync. So the callback was set to be always the last argument to not have \"null\" arguments in between, and that is why the fetchAll got put in between which breaks some older version calls.\n",
