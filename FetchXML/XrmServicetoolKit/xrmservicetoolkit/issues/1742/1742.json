While on my network at work, the library works exactly as expected within CRM.\n\nWhile I am VPN'd into my work, I'm able to get to the CRM server there just as if I'm in the office, however, all XRMServiceToolkit functions stop working with the following error:\n\nInvalid Character\nFile: cxa_xrmservicetoolkit.js, Line: 760, Column: 21\n\n//It appears to be happening on the successCallback line.\nif (this.status === 200) {\n          successCallback(JSON.parse(this.responseText, dateReviver).d);\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks!",

      "Message": "Hi There.[0A][0A]Do you mean that the code stops working within CRM or through development?[0A][0A]Which version was used? As for VPN, I have seen various behaviour of REST/SOAP calls (not limited to the toolkit) depending on the VPN configuration. Sometimes you will see a cross domain call is made which is why the code will not work.[0A][0A]Cheers,[0A]Jaimie",
