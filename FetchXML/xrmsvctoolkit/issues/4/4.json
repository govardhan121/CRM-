    "Description": "Hi\r\nExcellent add-on, I am using and acknowledging as part of a new add-on (www.summaryplus.com) which I am shortly releasing for beta.\r\n\r\nI have an issue which may be with XrmSvcToolkit though I cannot pin it down. I am retrieving a record which may have leading spaces but somewhere along the line leading spaces seem to get dropped. I cannot work out whether this is in the SOAP return itself or in XrmSvcToolkit.\r\n\r\nIf the latter, it is in getFetchResults.\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.2.\r\n\r\nI've got a fairly easy way round this as I have tried without success to pin it down, but thought I would raise as a possible issue. Browser is IE 9. Once I get released I will try to pin down some more and generate some test code.\r\nPaul\r\n",
