However I am trying to diagnose and although I have created many trial instances to see what was slowing down the form, two questions have arisen:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nDo I need to include the latest JQuery library with this toolkit on every CRM Form I use this on?<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nThe following code; I have set to async: true - but I am not noticing any performance improvements. I have added the code to the onLoad event handler, still seems to be slowing down the load time of the form. Any ideas how I can improve performance (the code block only retrieves Name, Telephone Number and Birthday, 3 columns) :<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nXrmSvcToolkit.retrieve({<br />\n<pre><code>        entityName: &quot;Contact&quot;,\n        id: contactGUID,\n        async: true, \n</code></pre>\n\nI am hoping that MS did not do anything to break this library. <br />\n",
