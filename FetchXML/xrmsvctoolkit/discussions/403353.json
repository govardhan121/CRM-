I have a situation where I need to use an expand/select part of the Odata query.</p>\r\n<p>I am using code based on the&nbsp;XrmSvcToolkitTest.aspx unit test that you provided. The issue I am running into is that when this part of code is about to execute: if(opts.length&gt;0||opts.length&gt;0) - It always evaluates as false - as the opts is not\r\n an array, but an object and does not have a length property(attribute).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Am I doing something wrong/or is this a known bug?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Peter</p>\r\n",
