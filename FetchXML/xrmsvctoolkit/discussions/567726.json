    "Html": "When I try to setState on a queue item with the following command XrmServiceToolkit.Soap.SetState(&quot;queueitem&quot;, firstPrimaryEntityId, 0, 1); I receive the following error message 'The queued entity instance does not allow associated queue item to be activated in its current state' no matter what state the email is in.
