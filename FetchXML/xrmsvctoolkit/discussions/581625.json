I was having similar issues on other entities referencing data from the Product entity, but I was able to work around those issues with either Business Rules or a Workflow; neither of which are an option on Order Product.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've tried another entity other as the middle linking entity, but I'm getting the same &quot;undefined&quot; message when I throw an alert to display the value of the lookup field I'm returning my retrieveMultiple.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo I need to return something other than the lookup field in my result set?
