But i want to know exact situation when will we use Asynchronous Plugin and when will use Asychronous Workflow.

One key difference is Images that you can use in Asynchronous Plugin, but not in workflow.
 I mean to say you can not register images for custom workflow. but for asyn plugins you can do that

You cannot make an Asynchronous Plug-in on demand like the way we can do it in workflows.
